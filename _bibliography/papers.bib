abstract = {Deep learning techniques with neural networks are developing prominently in recent years and have been deployed in numerous applications. Despite their great success, in many scenarios it is important for the users to validate that the inferences are truly computed by legitimate neural networks with high accuracy, which is referred to as the integrity of machine learning predictions. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose zkCNN, a zero knowledge proof scheme for convolutional neural networks (CNN). The scheme allows the owner of the CNN model to prove to others that the prediction of a data sample is indeed calculated by the model, without leaking any information about the model itself. Our scheme can also be generalized to prove the accuracy of a secret CNN model on a public dataset.Underlying zkCNN is a new sumcheck protocol for proving fast Fourier transforms and convolutions with a linear prover time, which is even faster than computing the result asymptotically. We also introduce several improvements and generalizations on the interactive proofs for CNN predictions, including verifying the convolutional layer, the activation function of ReLU and the max pooling. Our scheme is highly efficient in practice. It can support the large CNN of VGG16 with 15 million parameters and 16 layers. It only takes 88.3 seconds to generate the proof, which is 1264\texttimes{} faster than existing schemes. The proof size is 341 kilobytes, and the verifier time is only 59.3 milliseconds. Our scheme can further scale to prove the accuracy of the same CNN on 20 images.},

abstract = {We propose a new doubly efficient interactive proof protocol for general arithmetic circuits. The protocol generalizes the interactive proof for layered circuits proposed by Goldwasser, Kalai and Rothblum to arbitrary circuits, while preserving the optimal prover complexity that is strictly linear to the size of the circuits. The proof size remains succinct for low depth circuits and the verifier time is sublinear for structured circuits. We then construct a new zero knowledge argument scheme for general arithmetic circuits using our new interactive proof protocol together with polynomial commitments. Our key technique is a new sumcheck equation that reduces a claim about the output of one layer to claims about its input only, instead of claims about all the layers above which inevitably incurs an overhead proportional to the depth of the circuit. We developed efficient algorithms for the prover to run this sumcheck protocol and to combine multiple claims back into one in linear time in the size of the circuit. Not only does our new protocol achieve optimal prover complexity asymptotically, but it is also efficient in practice. Our experiments show that it only takes 0.3 seconds to generate the proof for a circuit with more than 600,000 gates, which is 13 times faster than the original interactive proof protocol on the corresponding layered circuit. The proof size is 208 kilobytes and the verifier time is 66 milliseconds. Our implementation can take general arithmetic circuits directly, without transforming them to layered circuits with a high overhead on the size of the circuit.},
