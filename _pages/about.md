I am a PhD student in **UIUC** advised by **Yupeng Zhang**. Previously, I studied in **ACM Honor Class** at **Shanghai Jiao Tong University** and received my bachelor’s degree in 2020.

My research interests lie broadly in **cryptography and security**, especially succinct zero-knowledge proof systems and their applications in blockchain.

Here is my [CV](https://liutianyi.site/assets/pdf/tianyi.pdf).
