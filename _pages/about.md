Now I am a PhD student in **UIUC** advised by **Yupeng Zhang**. Previously, I was educated in **ACM Honor Class** in **Shanghai Jiao Tong University** and attained the bachelor degree in 2020.

My research interests lie broadly in **cryptography and security**, especially succinct zero-knowledge proof system and their applications in blockchain.

Here is my [Resume](https://liutianyi.site/assets/pdf/tianyi_resume.pdf).
